    "# 2.6 Building agents for complex tasks\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🚄 Preface\n",
    "\n",
    "Having completed the previous chapters, you have successfully built a Q&A bot – one that can accurately answer questions related to writing guidelines.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, many colleagues have raised a similar request: since the Q&A bot is well-versed in writing guidelines, could it assist in developing educational courses?\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's analyze the technical feasibility. You'll find that the bot can only retrieve writing guidelines from its internal knowledge base. It cannot access the latest research papers, nor can it automatically remember the progress of course development.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is because a standalone Large Language Model (LLM) is like a brain isolated in a room – it can think, but it lacks senses to receive real-time information, hands and feet to perform specific tasks, and the ability to learn continuously.\n",
    "\n",
    "To overcome these limitations, you need to build a complete system on top of an LLM, allowing it to perceive its environment, think, plan, execute tasks, and learn from experience, much like a domain expert. This system is called an Agent. It consists of the following core modules:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Core Module        | Function                                                  | Analogy         |\n",
    "|--------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|-----------------|\n",
    "| Thinking & Planning| LLM understands intent, breaks down tasks into executable steps | 🧠 Brain        |\n",
    "| Perception         | Receives user input, API responses, system status         | 👀 Senses       |\n",
    "| Execution          | Calls APIs, queries databases, sends messages             | ✋ Hands & Feet  |\n",
    "| Memory             | Stores history, experiences, lessons, supports decision-making | 📚 Memory       |\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "These four modules form a **\"Think-Act-Observe\"** closed loop. Through this cycle, an Agent can autonomously plan, execute tasks, and adjust its behavior based on real-world feedback to accomplish complex tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🍁 Goals\n",
    "\n",
    "Agent building is an experimental science; there is currently no standard methodology, so you will need to continuously explore and iterate on Agent architectures in practice. This section will delve into the core modules and evaluation system of Agents, helping you master:\n",
    "- Task Decomposition Capability: Breaking down complex requirements into executable steps.\n",
    "- Prototype Building Capability: Rapidly setting up business Agent systems.\n",
    "- Evaluation and Iteration Capability: Quantitatively diagnosing and continuously optimizing.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🛠️ Environment setup and basic tools\n",
    "\n",
    "At the start of this course, you will continue to learn how to use the OpenAI SDK to call LLMs. Here is an example:"

    "\n",
    "#### 1.1.1 Hardcoded solution: The simplest implementation\n",
    "To enable the bot to access internet information, the most direct approach is to write a web search tool function for it. This function will search for the user's question each time and send the search results along with the question to the LLM.\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose you have already written a function called web_search that can find information via a search engine. Now, when a user makes a request, you want the model to utilize this function.

    "#### 1.3.1 Why structured output is needed\n",
    "Now that you've solved the problem of \"which tool to call,\" the next step is to parse and execute the LLM's decision using code. However, you'll find that the LLM's results are interspersed with natural language and lack a fixed format:\n",

    "*   `search_arxiv_paper(query=\"Attention Is All You Need\")`\n",
    "\n",
    "This is because LLMs tend to generate diverse text, but what you need is an easy-to-parse, deterministic data format. To solve this problem, you need to turn it around and require the model to output strictly according to your predefined structured format.\n",
    "\n",
    "JSON is such an ideal format. A clearly defined JSON output is unambiguous and easy to parse:\n",
    "```json\n",
    "{\n",
    "  \"tool_name\": \"search_arxiv_paper\",\n",

    "    \"query\": \"Attention Is All You Need\"\n",

    "\n",
    "#### 1.3.2 Building a \"guide-validate-retry\" closed loop\n",
    "\n",
    "The next task is to ensure that the model can consistently and strictly output in the JSON structure you define. To achieve this, you need to establish a clear process.\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Define structure**: First, you need to precisely define your expected output structure. You can use JSON Schema (a language for describing JSON data structures) or define data models in Python code using libraries like Pydantic. This Schema explicitly states which fields the final output must contain and the type of each field, serving as the foundation of the entire process.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  **Construct the prompt**: In your prompt, in addition to giving task instructions, you should also include the complete Schema definition and provide one or two output examples that perfectly conform to this Schema. Through this \"instruction + example\" method, the model can more thoroughly understand your requirements.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.  **Validate and retry**: After receiving the model's output, the program must strictly validate it using the same Schema. If validation fails, the program should capture the validation error message and send it, along with the model's previous erroneous output, back to the model as a correction clue, requesting it to regenerate.\n",

To simplify development, many LLM service providers (such as Alibaba Cloud, OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, etc.) have built this capability into their APIs, which is known as **function calling** or **tool calling**.\n",

    "\n",
    "*   Call decision: The model automatically decides whether to call a tool based on user input and tool definitions. If a tool call is needed, the model returns a `tool_calls` field in its response, containing the name of the function to be called and the JSON parameters conforming to the Schema.\n",

    "    3. Wrap the function execution result into a message with `role: \"tool\"`.\n",

    "* **Manually implementing reliable tool calls**: You mastered how to build a \"guide-validate-retry\" closed loop to make the model stably output structured JSON instructions, and understood that this is the underlying logic for robust tool calls.\n",
    "* **Function calling and tool discovery**: You learned about \"function calling,\" an industry standard that encapsulates the complex process of tool calling into simple APIs. Furthermore, you also learned how the MCP protocol decouples tool definition from usage, solving the challenges of scalable reuse and maintenance.\n",
    "* **ReAct loop and development frameworks**: You recognized that tool calling is key to implementing the **ReAct (think-act-observe)** loop pattern and learned how to use development frameworks like AgentScope to free you from tedious manual implementations, allowing you to focus more on business logic.\n",

    "\n",
    "- Command-line arguments (changing `-p 8080` to `--port 8080`)\n",
    "- API version numbers (updating `v1/users` to `v2/users`)\n",

For example, if it changed `usr_id` to `user_id` in the first step, it is very likely to consider this a \"standardization improvement\" rather than an error during the second step of reflection.\n"

    "Self-reflection is more suitable for static text-level comparisons (e.g., checking if code has been accidentally modified), but its effectiveness is poor when you need to verify if the code can run normally.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is because LLMs are good at judging whether code \"looks reasonable,\" but cannot perform precise semantic validation like a compiler. More critically, the model cannot actually execute code—it cannot see runtime logs, catch error reports, or perceive library version conflicts or environment configuration issues.\n",
    "\n",
    "To solve this problem, we need to introduce an external feedback mechanism.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2.3.2 Mode two: External feedback\n",
    "##### 2.3.2.1 Using tools to validate results\n",
    "The core idea of external feedback is to execute the LLM's generated results in a real environment, then feed the execution results (success/failure, error messages, test reports, etc.) back to the model, allowing it to iterate and correct based on these concrete facts.\n",
    "\n",
    "If self-reflection is \"I think I did it right,\" then external feedback is \"facts prove whether I did it right.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Returning to our Jupyter Notebook course polishing scenario. Suppose the course contains some code examples, and we want to ensure that the code still runs correctly while polishing the text.\n",
    "\n",
    "This requires combining **tool use** (learned in the previous chapter) with reflection mechanisms. Here, the most direct source of external feedback is a code execution tool. AgentScope has a powerful `execute_python_code` tool built-in, which provides a secure code interpreter environment for the Agent, allowing it to truly execute Python code and retrieve results or error messages.\n",
    "\n",
    "The specific workflow is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Generate**: The writing Agent polishes the document and outputs the notebook content containing the code.\n",
    "2. **Interact with external tools**: The system automatically extracts code blocks and calls the `execute_python_code` tool to attempt execution.\n",
    "3. **Obtain external feedback**: The tool returns the execution result, let's say an error: `TypeError: get_user_data() got an unexpected keyword argument 'usr_id'`.\n",
    "4. **Correct**: The Agent receives this error feedback. It now clearly knows what went wrong with the code. Based on this feedback, it generates corrected code.\n",

    "*   **Scenario: Optimizing Matplotlib charts in research papers**\n",
    "    *   **Problem**: You ask the Agent to generate data visualization code for a research paper. The Agent generates a Matplotlib code that \"looks reasonable,\" containing correct data processing logic and plotting function calls. However, code that runs does not mean the chart looks good—the actual rendered chart might have overlapping axis labels, legends obscuring data points, fonts too small to read, color schemes unsuitable for printing, etc.\n",
    "    *   **External feedback solution**: The system calls a **code interpreter** tool to execute the Matplotlib code and returns the generated image file. The **Agent receives the actual rendered chart through visual input**, allowing it to intuitively identify visual problems (e.g., \"x-axis labels overlap,\" \"legend blocks critical data points\") and then specifically adjust code parameters (e.g., `plt.xticks(rotation=45)` to rotate labels, `bbox_to_anchor` to adjust legend position, increase `fontsize`). This \"generate-render-adjust\" loop ensures the final chart meets academic publication quality requirements.\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Scenario: Checking answers for complex calculation problems**\n",
    "    *   **Problem**: In a quantum mechanics lesson, you need to create a practice problem: \"What is the ground state energy in joules for an electron (`mass ≈ 9.11e-31 kg`) confined in a one-dimensional infinite potential well of length 1 nanometer (1e-9 m)? (Planck's constant `h ≈ 6.626e-34 J·s`)\". The Agent might make errors during the solution steps due to complex exponential calculations.\n",
    "    *   **External feedback solution**: The system identifies the expression needing calculation `(1**2 * (6.626e-34)**2) / (8 * 9.11e-31 * (1e-9)**2)` and hands it to a **code interpreter** or **calculator** tool for execution. The tool returns the precise numerical result. This objective calculation result is provided as feedback, allowing the Agent to correct its final answer.\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Scenario: Structured output validation**\n",
    "    *   **Problem**: You ask the Agent to generate a configuration file conforming to a specific JSON Schema, but it might omit required fields or use incorrect data types.\n",
    "    *   **External feedback solution**: The system uses libraries like Pydantic to validate the generated JSON. When the output does not conform to the Schema, the validator returns a detailed error report (e.g., \"field 'timeout' should be an integer, not a string\"). This objective, precise feedback allows the Agent to correct its output until it fully conforms to the predefined structure. This \"generate-validate-feedback\" loop is the most common and fundamental application of reflection mechanisms in practice."

    "## 3 Building workflows\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3.1 Single agent handling complex processes\n",
    "\n",
    "On Monday morning, you received this message:\n",
    "\n",
    "> \"The 'Introduction to Python Data Analysis' course submitted last Friday needs to be launched as soon as possible. Can you run it through our standard review process with your AI assistant? That means: 1) all code examples must run; 2) technical concepts must be sound; 3) the difficulty gradient should suit beginners; 4) the language style must conform to our guidelines. I need the results by 3 PM.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "You thought, this task is quite simple. Your bot can already validate code, so handling this \"composite task\" shouldn't be difficult. So you crammed all the requirements into one prompt:\n",
    "\n",
    "```plaintext\n",
    "prompt = \"\"\"Please complete the following course review tasks:\n",
    "1. Verify that all Python code runs correctly.\n",
    "2. Check the accuracy of technical concepts (especially the usage of pandas and numpy).\n",
    "3. Evaluate whether the difficulty curve is suitable for programming novices.\n",
    "4. Adjust the wording according to our style guide (avoid colloquialisms like \"very simple\" or \"super\").\n",
    "Please provide a complete review report.\"\"\"\n",
    "response = agent.run(prompt + course_content)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "A few minutes later, you opened the returned result:\n",
    "\n",
    "* The Agent indeed validated the code, but when \"optimizing the language,\" it changed `super()` in the code to `parent()`, because it felt \"super\" was too colloquial.\n",
    "* It found an error in the explanation of DataFrame in Chapter 3, and after correcting it, introduced a more serious error: stating that \"DataFrame is a built-in Python data structure.\"\n",
    "* As for difficulty assessment? It seemed to have forgotten about it when it reached the 50th issue.\n",
    "\n",
    "You tried to make it start over. This time it remembered to assess the difficulty but missed half of the code validation. The third time, it did all the tasks but \"corrected\" some originally correct concepts into errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "The problem is obvious: asking a single Agent to manage multiple complex tasks simultaneously is like asking an intern to answer four phones at once—something is bound to go wrong.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3.2 Analysis of failure causes\n",
    "#### 3.2.1 Forgetting effect of attention mechanisms\n",
    "\n",
    "When LLMs generate responses, their \"attention\" to information at different positions is uneven. When the Agent processes the fourth task (polishing language), the details of the first task (code validation) have been diluted by a large amount of intermediate information.\n",
    "\n",
    "Specifically, the model \"forgets\" the constraints validated earlier when making later modifications. For example, even if you have confirmed that `super()` is correct Python syntax, during the language polishing phase, the model might replace it because the word \"super\" seems colloquial, leading to code errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is not simply \"poor memory,\" but an inherent limitation of the self-attention mechanism in the Transformer architecture—the attention weights between tokens are diluted as the sequence length increases.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3.2.2 Cascading error amplification\n",
    "\n",
    "When executing multiple tasks sequentially, early errors become the \"factual basis\" for subsequent processing. Suppose the Agent incorrectly \"corrected\" the definition of DataFrame during the fact-checking phase (e.g., claiming it's built-in Python). This error would then enter the subsequent context.\n",
    "What's worse, the model would continue reasoning based on this erroneous \"fact\":\n",
    "\n",
    "- Since DataFrame is \"built-in,\" there's no need to import pandas.\n",
    "- Import statements would be removed from teaching examples.\n",
    "- All code examples would become invalid.\n",
    "\n",
    "This error propagation is not linear, but exponential—a small error can trigger a cascade of incorrect decisions.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3.2.3 Flattened understanding vs. structured requirements\n",
    "\n",
    "Your complex requirement is actually a task graph with an internal structure:\n",
    "- Some tasks can be performed in parallel (code checking and style checking don't interfere with each other).\n",
    "- Some tasks have dependencies (conceptual understanding must precede difficulty assessment).\n",
    "- Some tasks require a global perspective (evaluating the overall difficulty curve).\n",
    "\n",
    "But for the model, your prompt is just a flat sequence of tokens. It cannot automatically recognize these structural relationships and instead attempts to solve an inherently graph-structured problem with a linear generation process.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's like asking someone to play four games with different rules simultaneously, without telling them which can be played in turns and which must be played concurrently.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ultimately, relying on a single Agent to perform complex reviews is like building a house without blueprints; every brick laid might affect the structural stability of the entire building.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3.3 Several workflow patterns\n",
    "\n",

    "**How MoA works**:\n",
    "\n",
    "MoA divides participating models into two types of roles:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Proposers**: Multiple different models process the same task in parallel, each generating responses. These models may excel in certain aspects (e.g., logical reasoning, creative expression, factual accuracy).\n",
    "2. **Aggregator**: Receives the output from all proposers, and through critical evaluation, comparison, and merging, generates a higher-quality final response.\n",
    "\n",
    "Crucially, the aggregator does not simply choose the best answer; rather, it extracts the strengths from multiple responses to synthesize a result that surpasses any single model.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Advantages of MoA**:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Leverages model diversity**: Different models have different training data, architectures, and optimization goals, leading to varied performance across tasks. MoA can leverage the strengths of multiple models simultaneously.\n",
    "* **Enhanced robustness**: Even if a particular model performs poorly on certain inputs, the high-quality outputs from other models ensure a minimum level of quality for the final result.\n",
    "* **Emergent quality**: Research shows that even if the individual output quality of proposer models is low, the aggregated result can still surpass any single model—this is a direct manifestation of \"model collaborativeness.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "MOA is suitable for **open-ended or creative tasks** that have no single standard answer, require extremely high-quality results, and are of significant value.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Core copy writing**: Such as course slogans, promotional texts, brand stories.\n",
    "* **Complex decision analysis**: Synthesizing analysis reports from different models to form more comprehensive recommendations for new course directions.\n",
    "* **Code generation and optimization**: Allowing different models to generate example code, then having a review Agent select the best or perform integrated restructuring to achieve optimal teaching effects.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, the primary constraint of MOA is **cost**. Calling N expert Agents incurs N times the computational cost and corresponding latency. This is a strategy that exchanges resources for quality, and therefore must be used for critical tasks where \"the steel is used on the blade,\" not for routine, cost-sensitive daily tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Advanced: Multi-layer MoA**\n",
    "\n",
    "The MoA demonstrated above is a \"2-layer structure\": the first layer has multiple experts processing tasks in parallel, and the second layer consists of an aggregator synthesizing the outputs of all experts. However, MoA can also be **extended to 3 or more layers**, continuously refining and optimizing results through multiple iterations to achieve even more outstanding output quality than a single-layer MoA.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The core idea of multi-layer MoA** is to take the aggregated output of the previous layer as input for the next layer, which is then reviewed, critiqued, and improved by multiple experts, followed by a new aggregator performing a higher level of synthesis. This \"iterative refinement\" process is similar to multiple rounds of review and polishing in human teams; each round can uncover issues missed in previous rounds and stimulate new ideas, ultimately achieving a quality level that would be difficult to reach in a single round.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Advantages of multi-layer MoA**:\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Further quality improvement**: Experts in the second and third layers can build upon the results of the first layer, performing deeper analysis and optimization, much like an editorial team polishes a draft multiple times.\n",
    "*   **Enhanced error correction capability**: Even if some experts in the first layer make mistakes, experts in subsequent layers have the opportunity to discover and correct these errors, making the final result more reliable.\n",
    "*   **Emergence of creativity**：Multi-layered interaction may produce a \"1+1>2\" effect, where the collision of ideas among experts at different levels can spark innovative solutions that no single layer could generate on its own.\n",

    "**When to use multi-layer MoA**：\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Extremely high-value tasks**: Such as annual company strategic reports, important product launch texts, core curriculum system design. The success or failure of these tasks can directly impact business results, making them worth investing more resources.\n",
    "*   **Extremely high creative requirements**: Such as brand story creation, innovative teaching method design, scenarios that require multiple rounds of idea generation to spark the best creativity.\n",
    "*   **Extremely high fault tolerance requirements**: Such as legal documents, technical white papers, where any error could lead to severe consequences, requiring multi-layer review to ensure accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Cost trade-offs**：\n",
    "\n",
    "The cost of multi-layer MoA increases linearly with the number of layers. Taking the 3-layer architecture above as an example: 3 proposer models + 1 aggregator per layer means at least (3+1) + (3+1) + 1 = 9 model calls, which is more than double the cost of a single layer's 3+1=4 calls. Therefore, multi-layer MoA should only be considered when the value of the task significantly outweighs the cost, and not for routine, cost-sensitive daily tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can balance cost and quality with the following strategies:\n",
    "*   **Reduce the number of proposers**: Use 3-4 different models in the first layer for diversity, and then reduce to 2-3 models for refinement in subsequent layers.\n",
    "*   **Reduce the number of layers**: For most tasks, 2-layer MoA (proposer layer + aggregation layer) can already provide significant quality improvement. 3 or more layers are usually only worth using for extremely high-value tasks.\n",
    "*   **Hybrid model configuration**: Mix models of different performance and costs among the proposers, and use the highest quality model for the aggregator to ensure the final output quality.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Further reading: Cost optimization and resource management for workflows**\n",
    ">\n",
    "> You've already realized that advanced patterns like Mixture-of-Agents (MoA) can significantly increase costs. This raises a crucial question that must be addressed before any workflow is put into production: how to manage resources and optimize costs? Fortunately, you can significantly reduce the operational costs of workflows without sacrificing too much quality by implementing a series of sophisticated engineering strategies.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> *   **Differentiated model allocation**: Different nodes in a workflow can vary greatly in task complexity and importance. You can assign lightweight, inexpensive models to simple tasks (e.g., intent recognition, format conversion) and reserve expensive, advanced models only for the most critical core tasks (e.g., final decision-making, content generation). Research shows that with reasonable optimization strategies, companies can save 40-70% of token costs depending on the specific implementation.\n",
    "> *   **Systematic caching**: By carefully observing your workflow, you will find that many node computations are repeatable. For example, retrieving the same company style guide, parsing the same course review request, etc. By adding caching mechanisms to these nodes, you can store intermediate results. When the same input is encountered next time, the system can directly return the cached result, completely bypassing model calls, thereby greatly reducing costs and latency.\n",
    "> *   **Smart batching**: Not all tasks require an immediate response. For non-real-time tasks like course quality report generation or user feedback analysis, you can design workflows to intelligently aggregate a batch of similar requests, then process them in a \"batch\" with a single model call, instead of calling the model separately for each request. This finds a better balance between cost and response time.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3.3.5 Pattern five: Human-in-the-loop (HITL)\n",
    "\n",
    "So far, all the workflows you've designed are fully automated. However, in the real world, fully entrusting all decision-making power to AI carries risks, especially when dealing with ambiguous teaching concepts or high-value course content. The Human-in-the-Loop pattern no longer pursues complete automation; instead, it intentionally designs one or more \"pause points\" in the workflow, handing control back to humans for decision-making, approval, or quality control, before returning the task to the workflow to continue execution. This is a critical pattern for building trustworthy and secure AI systems.\n",

    "\n",
    "*   **Limitations of a single Agent**: When faced with complex, multi-step tasks, a single Agent struggles to maintain a stable execution plan and is prone to failure due to “attention drift” or “error accumulation.”\n",

    "*   **Five core orchestration patterns**: You have learned about pipeline, branching, parallel execution, mixture-of-experts, and human-in-the-loop. These patterns address scenarios involving fixed processes, one-of-many decisions, performance through concurrency, quality-focused outputs, and human oversight, respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 4 From fixed processes to autonomous planning\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4.1 Limitations of fixed workflows\n",
    "\n",
    "In the previous chapter, you learned how to build fixed workflows for repetitive tasks. Suppose you developed a “course preliminary research” bot for your company with a predefined process: upon receiving a request, it concurrently analyzes user personas, competitor courses, and industry demands.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, a course designer sends the bot the following instruction:  \n",
    "“Please help me complete the preliminary research for a new Python introductory course.”\n",
    "\n",
    "The bot faithfully initiates your preset workflow:\n",
    "1.  **Industry demand analysis** subtask: tool call succeeds.\n",
    "2.  **User persona definition** subtask: tool call succeeds.\n",
    "3.  **Competitor course analysis** subtask: calls the `analyze_competitor_course` tool but receives an error:  \n",
    "    “**Error: Unable to parse course outline due to competitor website layout update.**”\n",
    "\n",
    "At this point, your bot cannot proceed further—because the designed workflow contains no logic to handle unexpected failures like “competitor analysis tool breakdown.”\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"https://img.alicdn.com/imgextra/i4/O1CN01gaGI3E1nRttOn9JCk_!!6000000005087-55-tps-2409-750.svg\" width=\"700\">\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4.2 Naive solution: Adding new branches\n",
    "\n",
    "You might think: just add an exception-handling branch. For example, if `analyze_competitor_course` fails, trigger a new step—such as notifying the course designer for manual intervention.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"https://img.alicdn.com/imgextra/i2/O1CN01UUnESl1ZKf0pf07q2_!!6000000003176-55-tps-3187-720.svg\" width=\"700\">\n",
    "\n",
    "This “patch-on-demand” approach may seem effective—but what if next time the industry demand analysis API is temporarily down? Would you add another branch? What if the data source format changes during user persona definition? Another branch again?\n",
    "\n",
    "You’ll quickly realize that it’s impossible to anticipate every possible failure mode. Predefining a handler for each exception leads to workflows that are overly complex, bloated, and hard to maintain. Worse, any unforeseen issue will still cause the entire system to stall.\n",
    "\n",
    "The root cause is this: the Agent is merely a faithful executor of a rigid process—not a problem solver. It doesn’t “understand” that the user’s ultimate goal is to “complete the course preliminary research.” It only knows to follow your flowchart step by step. When one path is blocked, it lacks the ability to adaptively find alternatives—unlike a human would—to achieve the end goal.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Further reading: Goal vs. Task**\n",
    ">\n",
    "> Understanding the distinction between “goal” and “task” is key to grasping autonomous planning in Agents.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> *   **Goal**: The desired end state the user wants to achieve. It is high-level and sometimes ambiguous.  \n",
    ">     Example: “Help me complete the preliminary research for a Python introductory course.”\n",
    "> *   **Task**: A concrete, well-defined action taken to move toward the goal.  \n",
    ">     Example: “Call the `analyze_competitor_course` tool with parameters `{url: 'some-site.com'}`.”\n",
    ">\n",
    "> An Agent limited to fixed workflows operates on “tasks.” When a task fails, it has no recourse. A more intelligent Agent focuses on the “goal.” Upon task failure, it recognizes that one route is blocked and autonomously devises new tasks to continue progressing toward the objective.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4.3 Enabling agents to plan autonomously\n",
    "\n",
    "This insight leads to a pivotal question: Can we delegate the power of “planning” to the Agent itself—so it can dynamically design and adjust its workflow when facing unknown challenges?\n",
    "\n",
    "This is precisely the core paradigm used in the industry to address such limitations: **Planning**.\n",
    "\n",
    "With planning capabilities, the Agent’s operational model undergoes a fundamental shift. The developer’s role evolves from “workflow designer” to “goal specifier” and “capability (tool) provider,” while the Agent upgrades from a “task executor” to a **“solution planner.”**\n",
    "\n",
    "Its new workflow looks like this:\n",
    "1.  **Receive goal**: The Agent accepts a high-level user goal (e.g., “Complete preliminary research for a Python course”).\n",
    "2.  **Dynamic planning**: The Agent’s “brain” (an LLM) reasons over the goal, decomposes it, and dynamically generates an **action plan**—a sequence of executable steps.\n",
    "3.  **Execute plan**: An execution engine carries out the plan by invoking tools step-by-step, just like running a standard workflow.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"https://img.alicdn.com/imgextra/i2/O1CN01WZYGdT1oFMfYInMqE_!!6000000005195-55-tps-3068-275.svg\" width=\"700\">\n",
    "\n",
    "In this paradigm, the “plan” itself becomes a first-class, generatable, and executable artifact. The LLM is no longer a static node within a pipeline—it becomes the **creator** of the workflow.\n",
    "\n",
    "To help you intuitively grasp this autonomous planning capability, we provide a complete example built with the AgentScope framework. It simulates the opening scenario: when the competitor analysis tool fails, the Agent autonomously replans and finds an alternative path to fulfill the user’s goal."

    "\n",
    "You have mastered a powerful method for LLMs to generate code for planning. This approach gives the Agent the ability to use complex logic such as variables, conditional statements, and loops.\n",
    "\n",
    "But there is still a potential bottleneck: the Agent is still limited by the toolset you provide in advance. What if, while executing a plan, it discovers it needs a new tool that you haven't provided, such as a function to calculate the frequency of different technical keywords on recruitment websites? What should it do then?\n",
    "\n",
    "The most direct way is for the Agent to stop and ask you (the developer) to write this new tool for it. But this interrupts the autonomous process of the task. Let's think further: since the Agent can already generate code for planning, can it also generate code for creating new capabilities?\n",
    "\n",
    "This leads to a more advanced planning capability: dynamic tool creation.\n",
    "\n",
    "To achieve this, in addition to providing specific business tools (like analyze_competitor_course), you need to provide the Agent with a core \"meta-tool\": a code interpreter.\n",
    "\n",
    "When the Agent identifies that existing tools cannot meet its needs, its plan will include a series of special steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Decision: The LLM analyzes the task and identifies the need for a new tool that currently doesn't exist.\n",
    "2. Generate code: In its plan, it will write a piece of code to define, test, and encapsulate a new tool function.\n",
    "3. Call new tool: After the new tool is successfully created in the code execution environment, the Agent can directly call it in subsequent plan steps, just as if the tool had existed from the beginning.\n",
    "4. Extend tool library: This newly generated tool can be added to the temporary tool library for the current task, for reuse in subsequent steps.\n",

    "By providing a code interpreter, you elevate the Agent from a mere tool **user** to a tool **creator**. Its capability boundaries are no longer restricted by your predefined toolset, thereby giving it true creativity and adaptability in problem-solving.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4.6 When to choose autonomous planning?\n",
    "\n",
    "You have learned about “fixed workflows” and “autonomous planning” modes. You might ask: should I always use the more intelligent autonomous planning in all scenarios and completely abandon fixed workflows?\n",
    "\n",
    "This thinking is incorrect. Higher autonomy modes are not a silver bullet, and lower autonomy modes also have wide application scenarios. In production practice, a very effective best practice is to adopt a **“explore-crystallize” hybrid mode**.\n",
    "\n",
    "This mode divides task processing into two stages:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Exploration phase**: For new, undefined tasks (e.g., you need to research a completely new, niche technology domain you’ve never encountered before), you cannot predefine a perfect process. In this case, you should deploy an autonomous planning Agent. Its task is to explore different paths to solve the problem, calling tools it deems appropriate, even if it makes mistakes or hits dead ends along the way. The ultimate goal is to find a stable solution path.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  **Crystallization phase**: When the autonomous planning Agent, after multiple explorations, validates and summarizes a stable, efficient solution path (e.g., it finds that the process of “first using tool A to crawl information from a specific website, then using tool B for data cleaning, and finally using tool C to generate a summary report” has the highest success rate), you can then abstract and crystallize this validated path into a reliable “fixed workflow” for subsequent large-scale, repetitive production calls.\n",
    "\n",
    "This way, you establish a continuously optimizing positive feedback loop.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4.7 Case study: Letting the agent operate web pages\n",
    "\n",
    "To help you understand more concretely how this “perceive-plan-act” loop is applied in actual products, let’s look at a case study of a highly autonomous web operating Agent, such as the open-source project Browser Use.\n",
    "\n",
    "Traditional web automation (RPA) tools require fixed operating scripts to be written for each website and each task. Once the website interface changes slightly, the script becomes invalid, leading to extremely high maintenance costs.\n",
    "\n",
    "An Agent with planning capabilities can fundamentally solve this problem. It does not rely on fixed scripts but **understands** the user’s goal like a human and **perceives** the current web page state to dynamically **plan** the next operation.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Breakdown of execution process:**  \n",
    "When a user gives the instruction “Search for books about AI on Amazon”:\n",
    "1.  **Understanding and initial planning**: The LLM breaks down the vague goal into a series of high-level steps: “1. Open Amazon website; 2. Find search bar; 3. Type ‘AI books’; 4. Click search; 5. Analyze results.”\n",
    "2.  **Action and perception**: The Agent executes the first step (opening the website). Then it “perceives” the new page—this includes not just looking at the HTML code but also potentially analyzing screenshots for visual layout to understand what elements are on the page.\n",
    "3.  **Decision and replanning**: Based on the perceived information, it decides the next action: find the input area that looks most like a “search bar.” If there are multiple input fields on the page, it will infer and judge based on location, labels, and other information.\n",
    "4.  **Loop execution**: It continues this “perceive-plan-act” loop until all steps are completed and returns the list of searched books.\n",
    "5.  **Exception handling**: If it encounters an unexpected event at any step, such as a captcha popping up after clicking search, it won’t get stuck. It will perceive this new situation and insert “handle captcha” as a new obstacle into the current plan, attempting to resolve it or ask the user for help.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"https://img.alicdn.com/imgextra/i2/O1CN01Rk5QY81Z1sm1V78Y9_!!6000000003135-55-tps-4563-766.svg\" width=\"700\">\n",
    "\n",
    "This case fully demonstrates the core advantage of a planning Agent: it is no longer a script executor but achieves true **adaptive** operation in dynamic, unknown web environments through a continuous “perceive-plan-act” loop.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4.8 Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s review what you’ve learned in this section:\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Limitations of fixed workflows**: When faced with unexpected obstacles like “tool failure,” preset fixed processes “get stuck” because they lack adaptability. Simply adding branches for every eventuality makes the process complex and difficult to maintain.\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **“Planning” is the core solution**: Mimicking how humans solve problems, we elevate the Agent from a “task executor” to a “solution planner.” It no longer passively executes fixed steps but autonomously generates and adjusts action plans around the user’s ultimate “goal.”\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Translating plans into action**: You can guide the LLM to generate structured plans (e.g., JSON or code) for precise machine execution. A more advanced method is to provide the Agent with a code interpreter, enabling it to dynamically create and use new tools during planning, breaking through the limitations of preset capabilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Balancing stability and flexibility**: “Autonomous planning” is suitable for exploring unknown, variable innovation tasks, while “fixed workflows” ensure the stability and efficiency of core business. In a production environment, you need to combine strategies like human-in-the-loop and explore-crystallize, making informed choices between these two modes based on specific business needs.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 5 Multi-agent collaboration\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5.1 Collaborating like a human team\n",
    "\n",
    "One day, your colleague suggested: Can the bot participate in developing course drafts? For example, writing a draft for an interactive course on Pandas data analysis. Of course, the bots should ideally handle courses from various domains, which might have different work stages. You will find that this is a more general task.\n",
    "\n",
    "You learned before:\n",
    "- For multi-stage tasks like writing, you cannot have a single Agent complete all tasks, as this often leads to the Agent forgetting things and poor work quality. It should be broken down into multiple steps, with each specialized step handled by a different expert Agent.\n",
    "- For creative, diverse tasks like writing, the steps for different types of course writing vary. You cannot enumerate all writing steps and hardcode them into workflows. You can try to let the Agent plan the writing process itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, the problem now becomes how to effectively organize multiple Agents, allowing them to plan and execute in parallel while also integrating their final work results.\n",
    "\n",
    "To achieve this, you can draw inspiration from how human expert teams work. Human experts have their respective areas of expertise, and they collaborate to complete complex tasks, often processing tasks in parallel. Therefore, you can also form an Agent Team, where each Agent is an expert in a relevant field, and they divide labor and collaborate in parallel.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5.2 Two collaboration patterns\n",
    "\n",
    "In terms of specific implementation, human expert teams typically follow two common patterns: one is decomposition and execution led by a project manager, and the other is brainstorming around a whiteboard. In multi-agent systems, these correspond to the hierarchical planning pattern and the co-creation collaboration pattern, respectively."

    "#### 5.2.1 **Pattern one: Hierarchical/team leader pattern**\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the most direct simulation of how a “project team” works, characterized by a centralized star-shaped structure. It introduces two roles:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Leader Agent**: In this example, it could be a “Course Project Manager” Agent. It is responsible for receiving and understanding top-level tasks (e.g., “Write a Pandas data analysis course”), breaking them down into multiple specific subtasks (“Design teaching outline,” “Provide core cases and code,” “Write course text”), and assigning these subtasks to appropriate team members. It is also responsible for tracking overall progress and, after all members complete their tasks, aggregating the results to form the final course document.\n",
    "2.  **Member Agents**: Each possesses expertise in a specific domain (teaching designer, data scientist, content writer), focusing on executing assigned subtasks and reporting back to the Leader upon completion.\n",

In this pattern, the Leader Agent treats each domain expert as a tool, and task assignment and reporting are achieved through tool calls. AgentScope also supports asynchronous tool calls and dynamic tool extension, meaning you can execute multiple expert Agents concurrently and even allow the Leader Agent to create expert Agents in real-time as needed."

    "When a course development project starts, the project manager breaks down the requirements document into a clear task list and then distributes it to **instructional designers, data scientists, and content writers**. The advantages of this pattern are obvious: **clear structure and well-defined responsibilities**. Everyone knows their tasks and deadlines, and the project manager can easily track overall progress, ensuring the project stays on track. Therefore, this pattern is very suitable for scenarios where **goals are clear and can be clearly decomposed into multiple parallel subtasks**.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, the limitations of this pattern also stem from its structure. **Instructional designers and data scientists** usually do not communicate directly but pass information through the project manager. If the **data scientist**, while writing code, finds that a theoretical point can be explained more simply with a different example, they need to report to the manager first, who then relays it to the designer. This process can involve **information delays or distortions**. Ultimately, although all modules of the course are completed with high quality, their combination might feel somewhat disjointed, lacking a seamless flow. This is because there is a lack of direct, real-time intellectual exchange among the experts.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 5.2.2 Pattern two: Co-creation/blackboard pattern\n",
    "\n",
    "In this pattern, there is no high-level coordinator; instead, a group of experts in a meeting room conduct a **“brainstorming session”** around a whiteboard. Its characteristic is decentralization.\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Establish a shared space (Shared Blackboard)**: Create a shared space that all Agents can read and write (e.g., a shared document, database record, or message queue).\n",
    "2.  **Parallel contribution and iteration**: When an open-ended question (such as “Design an interesting project case for a new course”) is posted to the shared space, all expert Agents (**instructional designers, data scientists, content writers**) simultaneously begin thinking and write their ideas, arguments, or draft solutions into the shared space.\n",
    "3.  **Stimulation and deepening**: In each iteration, all Agents read all new ideas from others in the shared space. These ideas will inspire them to generate new insights, or to revise, supplement, or question their own solutions, and then write the updated ideas back. For example, the **data scientist** Agent proposes using “analyzing user movie rating data” as a case; the **instructional designer** Agent sees this and adds, “students can be guided to explore rating trends for different movie genres”; and the **content writer** Agent suggests, “the case can be packaged as a story titled ‘Unveiling the Movie Recommendation System’.”\n",
    "4.  **Reach consensus**: This “read-think-write” loop continues until a final solution, approved by most Agents, emerges in the system, or a preset number of iterations is reached.\n",

At the same time, all members need to constantly synchronize and process massive amounts of information from others, which places higher demands on controlling communication costs.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5.3 Selection advice: Design derived from reality\n",
    "\n",
    "After understanding the hierarchical planning and co-creation collaboration patterns, a natural question arises: which one should I choose? Or, are there other patterns?\n",
    "\n",
    "The answer is: **there is no “best pattern.”** An excellent Multi-Agent system’s design often comes from imitating and refining the real world.\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of memorizing abstract pattern names, delve into your business and observe how human expert teams complete similar tasks in the real world. When observing, you can focus on these three aspects:\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Business process**: What stages does the task itself involve? Are these stages upstream-dependent or can they be parallel? How do they connect?\n",
    "*   **Expert roles**: Which experts with different capabilities are needed in this process? What are their core responsibilities?\n",
    "*   **Collaboration method**: How do experts communicate? Is it through a centralized project manager relaying information, or do they freely discuss around a whiteboard in a meeting room? How does information flow between them?\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on these observations, you can follow a clear design path:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **① Observe reality**: Deeply understand how human teams work.\n",
    "2.  **② Recreate the process**: Map real-world roles and collaboration processes to your Agent roles and collaboration mechanisms.\n",
    "3.  **③ Iterate and improve**: Optimize and enhance based on the recreation, leveraging AI’s advantages.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, in our course development case, the “project manager” pattern simulates projects with clear deliverables; the “brainstorming” pattern simulates early creative idea generation meetings. In reality, a complete project might even combine both: first, determine core ideas through “brainstorming,” then switch to the “project manager” pattern for division of labor and execution. This hybrid pattern retains the controllability of the overall structure while introducing creativity at key nodes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ultimately, remember this core idea:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Instead of memorizing what Multi-Agent patterns exist, delve into the business and observe how human experts collaborate in the real world.**\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5.4 Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s review what you’ve learned in this section:\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Limitations of monolithic Agents**: A single Agent striving for “omnipotence” often performs poorly on complex tasks spanning multiple specialized domains (like course development) due to knowledge boundaries and cognitive overload.\n",
    "*   **Core idea of multi-agent systems**: From the failure of rigid “pipeline” patterns, you were inspired by efficient real-world teams, recognizing that “specialized division of labor, parallel processing, and communication integration” are key to solving complex problems.\n",
    "*   **Multi-agent collaboration patterns**: You mastered two mainstream collaboration patterns. The **hierarchical planning pattern** efficiently handles clearly decomposable tasks by simulating a “project manager–expert” structure; the **co-creation collaboration pattern** leverages collective intelligence for open-ended problems by simulating “brainstorming.”\n",
    "*   **Cost-value trade-off**: Although multi-agent systems can increase call costs and latency, they improve the “usability” of the final output, avoiding repeated attempts and hidden costs caused by low-quality outputs. This is an effective investment for high-quality results.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 6 Giving the agent memory\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section, you will learn how to give your Agent memory capabilities, solving the inherent “forgetfulness” problem of LLMs. You will start with the simplest method, gradually discover its limitations, and finally master mainstream short-term and long-term memory construction strategies.\n",
    "\n",

    "### 6.1 Establishing short-term memory\n",
    "\n",
    "In previous lessons, you were building an Agent team to help you write courses. The content writing Agent just finished an excellent first draft. You were pleased and said to it: \"Great, now please make the second part more engaging, according to the teaching style we discussed last time.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "However, the Agent's response disappointed you: \"Okay, what teaching style did we discuss last time?\" It had forgotten the details of the previous task. This is because your Agent is stateless. Each time a new conversation starts, it forgets everything from past conversations.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Further reading: Core characteristic of LLMs – statelessness**  \n",
    ">\n",
    "> You can imagine an LLM as an expert with only a few seconds of memory. In each independent API call, it can understand all the information you give it and provide brilliant answers. But once that call ends, it completely forgets everything. It won't remember who you are, what you talked about before, or any of your preferences and requirements. Every reply from an Agent is essentially an independent API call, so it naturally inherits this statelessness.\n",

    "### 6.2 Information refinement\n",
    "\n",
    "However, when you put this Agent into a real scenario and use it for a dozen or dozens of conversations, two serious problems will emerge:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Context window limitations**. Every LLM has a maximum text length it can process, which we call the \"context window.\" As the number of conversation turns increases, the conversation history will snowball, eventually exceeding the model's window limit, and the program will directly throw an error.\n",
    "2. **Rapidly rising costs**. LLM API calls are billed per usage; every token you send (input) and every token it generates (output) costs money. After multiple turns of conversation, each API call needs to resend the entire history, incurring repetitive token costs.\n",
    "\n",
    "This naive \"memory\" solution is merely a short-term strategy of \"eating next year’s crop.\" It will soon lead to program exceptions or cost overruns.\n",
    "\n",
    "This leads to a core question: **How can we effectively manage context length and cost without sacrificing critical information?**\n",
    "\n",
    "The essence of this problem is how to efficiently **compress** and **filter** information. Just like when you prepare for an open-book exam, you don’t copy the entire textbook onto your cheat sheet; instead, you extract the most important formulas, definitions, and key arguments.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6.3 Memory management strategies\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s learn from how humans prepare for exams to explore strategies for managing Agent memory.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 6.3.1 Strategy one: Simple \"forgetting\" – fixed window truncation\n",
    "\n",
    "The simplest and most crude method is to only remember recent events, which is called **fixed window truncation**.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Idea**: You set a fixed window size—for example, only retaining the most recent N turns of conversation, or more precisely, only the most recent N tokens. When the conversation history exceeds this size, the oldest turn of conversation is discarded, ensuring the total context length remains basically constant.\n",
    "- **Relative advantages**: Extremely simple to implement, low computational overhead, effectively ensures that context length is always within a controllable range, avoiding errors and unlimited cost growth.\n",
    "- **Applicable scenarios**: Suitable for scenarios where information value decays rapidly over time, such as chatbots or simple customer service Q&A.\n",
    "- **Boundary conditions**: This is a “one-size-fits-all” forgetting solution. If critical information from early in the conversation (e.g., the user’s core goal set in the first turn) is truncated, the Agent will “forget” again, leading to broken conversational logic.\n",

    "In `AgentScope`, this functionality is implemented by the `Formatter` component. You can pass the `max_tokens` parameter when initializing `Formatter` to limit the context length."

    "\n",
    "Through the combination of the above strategies, you have built a complete memory system for the Agent, which can be clearly divided into two parts:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Short-term memory: Based on a conversational buffer, managed through truncation or summarization strategies. Its core responsibility is to maintain the coherence of the current conversation. For example, remembering your recently stated specific requirement about \"adding a case to Chapter Two.\"  \n",
    "* Long-term memory: Based on a vector database and tool-based calls. Its core responsibility is to persistently store critical information and support intelligent retrieval across sessions. For example, remembering that the core goal of the entire course project is \"to design for beginners, with a humorous and engaging style.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "An Agent with memory is no longer a cold, one-off Q&A machine. It can learn from experience, remember your preferences, understand long-term context, and ultimately evolve from a simple \"tool\" to a true \"partner.\"\n",

    ">\n",
    "> **I. Quickly introduce memory capabilities**  \n",
    ">\n",
    "> You can leverage mature open-source frameworks or platforms to quickly add memory capabilities to your Agent.  \n",

    "> **II. Memory usage recommendations**  \n",
    ">\n",
    "> * Selective memory: More memory is not always better. Accumulating a large amount of low-value or noisy information can interfere with subsequent retrieval effectiveness. You should establish an admission mechanism for memory writing, for example, only writing when the user explicitly requests it (\"Please remember...\") or when the information's importance exceeds a certain threshold. The agent_control pattern is a good way to achieve this.  \n",
    "> * Continuous governance: Memory is a dynamic data asset that requires a continuous governance mechanism, including regularly cleaning outdated information, merging duplicate entries, verifying factual accuracy, and providing users with an interface to actively manage their own memories (view, modify, delete).  \n",
    "> * Scenario-based application: Different business scenarios have different memory needs. For example, in a course document workflow requiring consistent style, personalized preferences should not be recorded; but for product factual information (such as API parameters, functional limitations), it can be recorded and regularly reviewed for validity to ensure the accuracy of content generated by the Agent.\n",

    "### 6.4 Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's review what you've learned in this section:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Root cause of the problem: Statelessness: LLMs themselves have no memory; each call is independent. Naively passing the complete history leads to excessively long contexts and uncontrolled costs.  \n",
    "* Short-term vs. long-term memory: You can manage short-term memory through \"truncation\" and \"summarization\" strategies to maintain current conversation coherence; you can build long-term memory through \"vector-based retrieval\" to enable cross-session knowledge storage and access.  \n",
    "* Active memory management: By providing the Agent with memory tools like save, recall, update, you can transform it from passively receiving context to an intelligent agent capable of actively managing and utilizing its own memory, achieving true learning and growth.  \n",
    "* Best practices for memory: A powerful memory system needs effective governance. You should selectively write, continuously clean, and update memories, and decide what to remember and what not to remember based on specific business scenarios (such as course writing).\n",

    "## 7 Evaluation-driven development\n",
    "\n",
    "### 7.1 Why \"feeling okay\" is unreliable\n",
    "\n",
    "You just deployed the first version of your \"Course Writing Agent.\" When testing it locally with a few examples, it seemed \"pretty good.\" But after going live, user feedback was disappointing. Some complained that the explanations of technical concepts were inaccurate, others found the responses too verbose, and some encountered formatting errors where code examples couldn't run.\n",
    "\n",
    "You immediately tried to fix it, for example, by adjusting the prompt to make the Agent's explanations \"more accurate.\" After the changes, you re-entered the topic \"Introduction to Python's for loop,\" quickly scanned the generated content, and felt \"this time it's written pretty well, the language is smooth.\" But when you deployed it online, new problems emerged. You were stuck: what exactly was the problem? Did the recent changes optimize or degrade overall performance?\n",
    "\n",
    "> For example, you found that when the Agent explained \"overfitting\" in machine learning, its examples were too academic and not accessible enough. So you gave the Agent an instruction:  \n",
    ">\n",
    "> `...when explaining complex concepts, please use everyday analogies...`  \n",
    ">\n",
    "> After running, it indeed used the analogy of \"memorizing answers for an exam instead of truly understanding the knowledge\" to explain overfitting, which worked well. But you soon found that when generating a course on \"Pandas data filtering,\" it awkwardly inserted an inappropriate analogy, making a simple operation complex and difficult to understand.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 7.2 If it cannot be measured, it cannot be improved\n",
    "\n",
    "The fundamental problem you encountered is the lack of an objective, quantifiable standard. The most direct idea, which you are currently doing, is to manually test a few cases and judge based on subjective feeling. But this \"feeling good\" approach quickly exposes its inherent flaws:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Difficult to quantify: \"Feeling better\" cannot serve as a basis for engineering decisions. You can't know if this improvement was 10% or 20% better than last time.  \n",
    "* Lack of standards: What you consider \"examples too complex\" today might be seen as \"deep content\" if you're in a different mood tomorrow. Different testers and different times can lead to shifting evaluation standards.  \n",
    "* Irreproducible: You cannot systematically run regression tests to ensure new changes haven't broken previously good performance. When you fix the \"inappropriate analogy\" problem, you cannot guarantee that a previous \"clear explanation\" advantage hasn't been accidentally compromised.\n",
    "\n",
    "Why is this the case? It stems from how Agents work. The generation process of LLMs is probabilistic, and the models themselves lack a \"self-correction\" mechanism. Even minor adjustments to your prompt can trigger unpredictable \"butterfly effects\" in a complex system.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since debugging by feeling is not feasible, you naturally think of another approach: establish a systematic evaluation framework, using data rather than feelings to drive development. This is like preparing for an exam; you can't just rely on \"feeling like you've learned it,\" but need to objectively test your mastery by doing practice papers.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is evaluation-driven development. It elevates evaluation from the end of the development process to a core position that determines direction.\n",
    "\n",
    "This philosophy is based on three interconnected principles:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Evaluation, or your \"taste\" for good and bad, determines the upper limit of product capability.  \n",
    "* What can be measured can be effectively improved.  \n",
    "* The faster and more accurate the measurement feedback, the higher the efficiency and effectiveness of improvement.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 7.3 Two evaluation methods: From macro to micro\n",
    "\n",
    "To build an effective evaluation system, you need to examine your Agent from two dimensions: end-to-end evaluation and white-box evaluation.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 7.3.1 Evaluation method one: End-to-end evaluation\n",
    "\n",
    "End-to-end evaluation focuses on the final output of the system. It answers the most important question: \"Is the course generated by this Agent useful for users?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "##### 7.3.1.1 Iterative establishment of evaluation criteria\n",
    "\n",
    "For complex Agent systems, you cannot predefine all perfect evaluation metrics before the project begins. The correct approach is to embrace iteration. Evaluation is important, but getting started quickly is more important:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Rapid prototyping: First build a Minimum Viable Product (MVP).  \n",
    "2. Observe problems: Run it in a real scenario and observe where it makes mistakes.  \n",
    "3. Summarize key points: From these errors, identify the critical points that need to be prioritized for evaluation at the current stage and convert them into evaluation metrics.\n",
    "\n",
    "> For example, in the first version of content generated by your course writing Agent, you found that code examples often lacked necessary import statements, making them unable to run directly. This is a clear, high-priority error. Thus, you established the first evaluation metric: \"Code executability\"—all code blocks must be self-contained and syntactically correct. Then, you found that the Agent, in an attempt to make the language more vivid, overused metaphors, which instead made core concepts vague. So, you added a second evaluation metric: \"Explanation clarity,\" with a clear requirement to avoid inappropriate metaphors.\n",
    "\n",
    "This loop repeats, and your evaluation system becomes increasingly perfect and precise as the Agent evolves. The figure below shows this complete closed-loop process:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"https://img.alicdn.com/imgextra/i1/O1CN01I8JNo11e127NWm4wM_!!6000000003810-55-tps-2904-796.svg\" width=\"700\">\n",
    "\n",
    "As shown, starting from MVP, through real operation, error observation, metric refinement, combined with both objective and subjective evaluation methods, ultimately leads to continuous improvement of the Agent. Next, we delve into how to design these two types of metrics.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### 7.3.1.2 Designing evaluation metrics: Objective and subjective\n",
    "\n",
    "A comprehensive evaluation system needs to include both objective and subjective metrics.\n",
    "\n",
    "| Type | Description | \"Course writing Agent\" case |\n",
    "| :--- | :--- | :--- |\n",
    "| **Objective metrics** | Can be directly judged by code rules, results are deterministic. | • **Code executability**: Can the generated code snippets be successfully run by a Python interpreter?<br>• **Format check**: Does it include all required sections like \"pain points,\" \"solutions,\" \"summary\"?<br>• **Word count limit**: Is the length of each section between 300-500 words? |\n",
    "| **Subjective metrics** | Involve semantics, logic, and quality, usually requiring stronger intelligence to judge. | • **Content accuracy**: Are there factual errors in the explanation of technical concepts?<br>• **Teaching effectiveness**: Do the introduced cases stimulate learning interest? Are explanations from simple to complex?<br>• **Language style**: Does it conform to the \"rigorous, precise, calm\" course setting? |\n",
    "\n",
    "But the core problem here is: who defines these metrics? Especially subjective metrics, such as \"teaching effectiveness\" and \"language style,\" what do they really mean?\n",
    "\n",
    "**The key is that evaluation metrics must be led by the most senior business experts in your team.** For your \"course writing Agent,\" these people are top instructional designers and senior lecturers. However, there is a common misconception to avoid here:\n",
    "\n",
    "Many teams' approach is that technical staff first build an initial version of the Agent, and when they find the effect is not ideal, they then go to business experts to \"extract knowledge\"—asking them, \"What do you think makes a good course?\" Then the technical team goes back and tries to translate these vague descriptions into evaluation rules. This model is often inefficient because:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Experts lack motivation to participate: They are positioned as \"knowledge providers\" rather than co-builders of the project. Without seeing a direct link to their business goals, their enthusiasm for participation is low.  \n",
    "* Knowledge translation loss: Technical staff find it difficult to fully understand experts' implicit knowledge, and key elements are easily misinterpreted or overlooked during translation.  \n",
    "* Long feedback cycle: By the time the technical team implements and then returns for verification, they have often taken a detour, requiring significant rework.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The correct approach is to empower business experts as the owners of the evaluation system from day one of the project, with the technical team acting as facilitators.** Specifically:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Mobilize participation with business goals**: Don't say, \"We need your help to define evaluation metrics.\" Instead, say, \"This Agent will help us achieve [specific business goal, such as 'reduce course production time from 2 weeks to 3 days while maintaining over 90% user satisfaction']. As a guardian of course quality, you need to define what constitutes an 'acceptable quality baseline'.\" When experts see this directly relates to business outcomes they care about, their willingness to participate will significantly increase.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Provide structured tools to lower participation barriers**: The value of the technical team lies in providing scaffolding, not doing the work for them. For example:  \n",
    "   ○ **Evaluation metrics workshop**: Organize experts for structured dialogue, guiding them with questions like \"If you could only use three metrics to judge course quality, which three would you choose?\"  \n",
    "   ○ **Rating scale templates**: Provide fill-in-the-blank templates for \"1-5 points, what specific characteristics correspond to each score?\" so experts fill it out rather than describing from scratch.  \n",
    "   ○ **Case annotation tools**: Allow experts to directly annotate \"what's good, what's bad\" on actual Agent outputs, and then reverse-engineer rules from that.  \n",
    "\n",
    "> For example, when an expert annotates a lesson plan with \"feels too bland,\" the technical facilitator needs to ask: 'Bland' means it lacks relatable pain points? This can then refine into the metric 'relevance of opening case'.  \n",
    ">\n",
    "> When an expert says 'students won't understand,' dig deeper: is the concept jump too fast, for example, talking about 'lists' without explaining 'variables' first? This can then be transformed into the metric 'logical progression of theory'.  \n",
    ">\n",
    "> Through this dialogue, you can encode the expert's 'taste' into measurable evaluation items.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Establish continuous collaboration mechanisms**: Evaluation standards are not one-time documents but living documents that evolve with Agent capabilities and business needs. In weekly review meetings, experts review data, the technical team adjusts the system, and both parties jointly decide the next optimization direction.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this way, experts are no longer objects from whom \"knowledge is extracted,\" but true owners of the evaluation system. Their \"teaching intuition\" (i.e., \"tacit knowledge\") is systematically transformed into executable and iterative evaluation rules with the aid of structured tools."

    "##### 7.3.1.3 Improving the stability of subjective evaluation\n",
    "\n",
    "After defining the metrics, the next step is how to conduct the evaluation. You have two options: manual evaluation and automated evaluation with LLMs (LLM-as-a-Judge).\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Manual evaluation**: Human experts score according to evaluation criteria. This is the most reliable \"gold standard,\" especially in the early stages of a project, as it helps you calibrate the definitions of \"good\" and \"bad.\" However, its drawbacks are high cost, slow speed, and difficulty in scaling up and frequent execution.\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **LLM-based automated evaluation**: Train or guide another LLM to act as an \"evaluation expert,\" automatically scoring the \"course writing Agent's\" output based on your defined metrics and scoring rubrics.\n",
    "\n",
    "To make LLM evaluation more stable, you need to break down a vague evaluation goal (e.g., \"good content quality\") into a series of specific, verifiable details. Then, let the LLM judge each item individually, and finally aggregate the scores according to rules.\n",
    "\n",
    "> For example, evaluating the \"content quality\" generated by the \"course writing Agent\" can be broken down into:\n",
    "> 1.  **Introduction of pain points**: Does it begin with an everyday, concrete pain point? (Yes/No)\n",
    "> 2.  **Theoretical elevation**: Does it clearly point out the limitations of preliminary solutions and introduce core theories? (Yes/No)\n",
    "> 3.  **Relevance of code examples**: Are the provided code examples closely related to the theory explained and sufficiently simplified? (Yes/No)\n",
    "\n",
    "**But you must be wary that LLM evaluation itself may be biased.**\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Further reading: LLM evaluator's \"mindset\"**\n",
    ">\n",
    "> Using an LLM as an evaluator is like hiring a knowledgeable expert who has personal biases. Its own training data determines its \"taste.\"\n",
    "> - **Style bias**: It might prefer a certain coding style (e.g., advocating method chaining), thereby giving lower scores to other equally correct but stylistically different code.\n",
    "> - **Length bias**: It might tend to believe that longer, more detailed explanations are \"more complete,\" thus unfairly penalizing answers that are \"concise but to the point.\"\n",
    "> - **\"People-pleaser\" bias**: Some models tend to give positive feedback and avoid conflict, making it difficult to uncover real problems.\n",
    "> - **Position bias**: Some studies show that when models process lists or compare multiple options, they might tend to choose options at the beginning or end. When designing evaluation prompts, consider randomizing the order of the content being evaluated to mitigate the impact of this bias.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> Therefore, the best practice is: **use human experts for evaluation in the early stages to establish a high-quality \"gold test set.\" Then, use this test set to \"calibrate\" your LLM evaluator**, checking its scoring consistency with human experts. In subsequent development, regularly use manual sampling to ensure the automated evaluation system hasn't \"gone off track.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 7.3.2 Evaluation method two: White-box evaluation\n",
    "\n",
    "When your Agent's process becomes complex, the drawbacks of end-to-end evaluation become apparent. For example, your \"course writing Agent\" might include a \"concept explanation\" component and a \"code generation\" component. If the final course score is not high, it's hard to tell whether the concept explanation was poor or the code examples were terrible.\n",
    "\n",
    "**White-box evaluation** is designed to solve this problem. It advocates going deep inside the system to **design a separate evaluation system for key components**.\n",
    "\n",
    "The core advantages of white-box evaluation are:\n",
    "*  **Clear signals**: Provides unambiguous improvement signals, allowing you to focus on the true bottlenecks.\n",
    "*  **Rapid iteration**: Only needs to test individual components, without running the entire complex process, greatly shortening the verification cycle.\n",
    "*  **Precise optimization**: Whether adjusting hyperparameters or replacing external services, their effects can be precisely measured, making decisions data-driven.\n",
    "\n",
    "> In this way, you can:\n",
    "> - **Individually evaluate the \"concept explanation\" component**: Build a test set containing a series of technical terms (e.g., \"list comprehension,\" \"decorators\"), and then only evaluate whether the text explanations generated by this component are clear and accurate.\n",
    "> - **Individually evaluate the \"code generation\" component**: Build a test set containing a series of task descriptions (e.g., \"generate a function to merge two dictionaries\"), and then only evaluate whether the generated code runs correctly and follows best practices.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> The advantage of this method is that it provides unambiguous improvement signals, allowing you to focus on true bottlenecks and achieve fast, precise optimization.\n",
    "\n",
    "In practice, you don't need to aim for a fully automated, comprehensive, multi-dimensional evaluation system from the start. For example, when dealing with code correctness, you can begin with the simplest method: manually copy and run the code a few times. Then, gradually upgrade to writing a script that automatically executes code and catches errors. Finally, you can build a complete evaluation pipeline with various metrics (style, efficiency, correctness). The ultimate choice depends on your specific needs, budget, and acceptable error rate."

    "> **Summary**: The code above demonstrates the minimal closed loop of \"evaluation-driven development\"—encoding the objective elements of a \"good lesson\" into executable checks using `Task + Metric`, and then running them end-to-end with a real API for quantitative scoring. You can try: fine-tuning `sys_prompt`, changing `model_name` or temperature, or improving metrics (e.g., checking if code runs, if it includes links to output screenshots), then repeat the evaluation and observe if the score improves. If `AGENTSCOPE_STUDIO_URL` or `OTEL_TRACING_URL` is set, you can also view the time consumption and trace details of models/tools/formatters in the tracing backend.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ultimately, transitioning from relying on subjective feelings to establishing an evaluation system that combines \"end-to-end\" and \"white-box\" approaches is the necessary path to building high-level Agents. This process essentially transforms vague \"good\" and \"bad\" standards into clear, executable engineering problems. Evaluation is not the end of development but the beginning of optimization. A powerful evaluation system will become your most reliable compass when exploring the boundaries of Agent capabilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 7.5 Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's review what you've learned in this section:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Beyond subjective feelings**: Agent optimization should move away from the \"feeling good\" pattern and towards evaluation-driven development based on objective data. This is a prerequisite for rigorous, controllable optimization.\n",
    "- **Experts define standards**: Evaluation metrics, especially subjective ones, should be primarily defined by senior business experts, translating their implicit knowledge into clear, measurable rules.\n",
    "- **Beware of model bias**: When using LLMs for automated evaluation, you must be wary of their inherent biases (e.g., style, length) and regularly calibrate them with \"gold test sets\" from human experts.\n",
    "- **Combine end-to-end and white-box approaches**: Use end-to-end evaluation to grasp the Agent's overall user value, while leveraging white-box evaluation to delve into key components, precisely identifying and resolving performance bottlenecks.\n",
    "- **Iterative refinement**: A powerful evaluation system evolves gradually rather than being built all at once. Start with the most critical and easiest parts to implement, and iterate continuously.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 8 Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "At this point, you have completed all the content of this chapter. Let's review and systematically organize the Agent knowledge you've just built from a more macroscopic perspective.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 8.1 Everything starts with \"user intent\"\n",
    "\n",
    "You started with a common pain point: a single LLM call, while capable of language tasks, often struggles when faced with complex tasks requiring multiple steps and interaction with the external world.\n",
    "\n",
    "To solve this problem, your goal is to build a system that can stably and reliably understand and fulfill true user intent. This is where the value of an Agent lies. If an LLM is a smart \"brain\" confined in a \"black box,\" then what you've learned in this chapter is how to build a complete \"engineering system\" around this \"brain,\" enabling it to accomplish complex real-world tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 8.2 Core methodology: Context engineering\n",
    "\n",
    "In exploring how to build Agents, you learned various engineering techniques. Now, let's examine these techniques from a core engineering perspective: **Context Engineering**.\n",
    "\n",
    "When you first encountered LLMs, you learned about **Prompt Engineering**, whose core is to enable the model to deliver the best output in a **single interaction** through carefully designed instructions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now you are dealing with complex tasks that span **multiple interactions** and involve **multiple external information sources**. At this point, your focus shifts from \"writing a good Prompt\" to systematically providing the most sufficient and precise **context** for every decision the model makes. This is context engineering.\n",
    "\n",
    "From this perspective, as the designer of an Agent, you are no longer just a \"questioner,\" but an **\"information architect.\"** Your core task is to design processes and call tools to build a perfect **\"information cocoon\"** for the LLM node responsible for final decisions, containing everything needed to solve the problem—no more and no less. **The quality of the context directly determines the upper limit of the Agent's capabilities.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Under the \"context engineering\" approach, the capabilities you learned in the first half of this chapter all have clear positions: they are specific means within the discipline of **\"context injection\"**:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Tool use**: Injecting real-time, deterministic information from the external world into the context.\n",
    "- **Reflection**: Using the \"evaluation result\" of the previous step as new feedback, revising the context for the next step to guide subsequent actions.\n",
    "- **Workflow**: Designing a relatively fixed task pipeline, specifying **when** and **by which node** to inject **what kind of context** into the model—like a dedicated \"context manipulation\" pipeline driving all subsequent steps to run stably.\n",
    "- **Memory system**: Retrieving the most relevant parts from massive historical information and injecting them into the current context to provide references for subsequent decisions.\n",
    "\n",
    "These capabilities do not exist in isolation but collectively serve the core goal of **\"optimizing context,\"** enabling the Agent to complete tasks more efficiently and reliably.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 8.3 Quality assurance: Evaluation-driven development\n",
    "\n",
    "Since context is key, how do you ensure the context you build is \"high-quality\"? The answer is: **evaluation**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Without measurement, there is no improvement. Transforming the Agent's development process from \"debugging by feeling\" to \"data-driven\" is crucial for its successful deployment in a production environment. To this end, you learned three complementary evaluation dimensions:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **End-to-end evaluation**: It answers the most important question: *\"Did the Agent ultimately fulfill the user's intent?\"* This is a macroscopic assessment from a business perspective.\n",
    "- **White-box evaluation**: It helps you pinpoint the problem: *\"Did the tool call fail, or was memory retrieval inaccurate?\"* This is a microscopic diagnosis that delves into the internal system, focusing on each \"context injection\" node.\n",
    "- **Continuous iteration**: Integrating evaluation into every aspect of development, forming a data-driven, continuously optimizing closed loop. This ensures that the Agent's capabilities can evolve with business development and data accumulation.\n",
    "\n",
    "By establishing such a **\"macro + micro + iterative\"** evaluation system, you gain a flywheel that drives continuous optimization of the Agent. More importantly, this system is not limited to context engineering but serves as the **\"feedback nervous system\"** for the entire Agent system, permeating subsequent autonomous planning and multi-agent collaboration.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 8.4 Outlook: More powerful autonomy\n",
    "\n",
    "So far, the \"context engineering\" we've discussed primarily focuses on building an Agent with exceptionally strong **\"individual capabilities\"** and clearly controllable behavior boundaries around a single task. You have mastered the basic paradigm of enabling it to use various tools, possess memory, and learn to reflect. This engineering approach, centered on fixed workflows, is already very powerful and represents the most mainstream and pragmatic implementation paradigm in the industry today.\n",
    "\n",
    "But the evolution of single Agents does not stop there. The next stage of its development is to grant it greater **\"autonomy\"**:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Autonomous planning**: The Agent no longer strictly executes your preset static workflow, but, like a project manager, autonomously plans, decomposes, and executes tasks based on the ultimate goal. This means the Agent gains the ability to dynamically adapt to problems and autonomously generate solutions.\n",
    "- **Multi-agent systems**: Building further on autonomous planning, this involves having multiple Agents with autonomous decision-making capabilities form a team, allowing them to autonomously divide labor, initiate collaboration, exchange information, and integrate intermediate results around a common goal—rather than having you hardcode each collaboration process. At this point, the system's \"autonomy\" is no longer limited to the planning capabilities of a single Agent but is amplified into a **collective intelligence** closer to a real team through the interaction of multiple Agents.\n",
    "\n",
    "This represents a leap in Agent systems from a mode primarily focused on engineering controllability to one of more open autonomy and emergent behavior. While the structured workflows you've learned are the most reliable foundation for current engineering practices, exploring advanced capabilities like autonomous planning and multi-agent collaboration will be key to unlocking the next phase of Agent potential.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ultimately, you need to keep pace with the times. First, apply the context engineering and evaluation system you've learned to practice, building an Agent engineering system with fixed workflows as its skeleton, controllable behavior, and high reliability. On this foundation, under the guidance and constraints of the same evaluation and feedback mechanism, gradually introduce autonomous planning and multi-agent collaboration, allowing the system to progress towards more open autonomy and emergent intelligence while ensuring controllability.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Final Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "An excellent Agent system is not a single advanced technology but a combination of two complementary approaches:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Engineered controllable autonomy**: Deeply understand business scenarios, translate efficient real-world processes and evaluation principles into the Agent's workflows and evaluation system, and meticulously control every aspect through context engineering to maximize the model's \"individual capabilities\" within clear boundaries, thereby building a reliable and controllable Agent engineering system. This is the **\"engineering foundation\"** at the strategic and tactical levels.\n",
    "2. **Open-ended autonomous evolution**: On top of this engineering foundation, and under the constraints and guidance of the same evaluation and feedback mechanism, introduce autonomous planning and multi-agent collaboration. This allows Agents to move beyond passively executing preset processes, enabling them to plan, divide tasks, collaborate, and generate emergent behaviors around a goal, gradually raising the overall intelligence ceiling of the system while maintaining controllability. This represents **\"intelligent evolution\"** for the future.\n",
    "\n",
    "By mastering these two approaches, you will have the foundation to build powerful, reliable, and continuously evolving intelligent systems. Now is the time to use them to realize your creativity and build your own AI applications, systems, and services."
